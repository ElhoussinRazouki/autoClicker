# autoClicker
in this tool i use the user32.dll library to interact with the Windows operating system and simulate mouse clicks.
It allows the user to specify the position of the mouse click, the mouse button to use, the number of clicks,
and the interval between each click. The application also includes a GUI that displays the current position of the mouse.

The code includes event handlers for key presses and timer ticks, which allows it to react to user input and automate the mouse clicks.
